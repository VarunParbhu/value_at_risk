# Value-at-Risk Analysis of an Optimized Portfolio consisting of Human Capital Management Company Stocks
## Abstract
	Human Capital Management (HCM) companies have been growing significantly in the last years due to high demand in the market. CDAY is the latest index in the market which will soon be followed by PYCR (Paycor HCM). The Value-at-Risk of fairly new stock indexes can be highly overestimated or underestimated from its historical values. We do not have enough data to make estimate the VaR. We study the historical VaR, parametric VaR and modified VaR of an optimized portfolio containing the 8 HCM companies. The optimized portfolio is then simulated for the next 30 days through 10,000 trials to compare the historical estimated VaR and simulated VaR. It is observed that the historical VaR is higher than the simulated VaR. This significant difference is explained by the lack of data. We observe that our 1-Day VaR for the portfolio for the multivariate normal distribution (MVT) and the GARCH (1,1) model is very close to the Gaussian parametric VaR that was estimated from the historical data. Estimating the 30th day VaR using the 1-Day VaR_hist and 1-Day VaR_modi was considerably higher simulated 30th day VaR for both MVN and GARCH (1,1).
